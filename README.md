Project Overview:
Goal: Predict solar energy output based on geographical placement by fetching relevant data (e.g., solar irradiance, weather, etc) and visualizing it on a map.

key features:
1) Data scraping (using web scraping)
2) Data processing and machine learning for prediction
3) Visualization (geographical maps and charts)
4) Version control
